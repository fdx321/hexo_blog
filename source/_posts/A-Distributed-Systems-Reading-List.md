Introduction
------------

I often argue that the toughest thing about distributed systems is
changing the way you think. The below is a collection of material I've
found useful for motivating these changes.

Thought Provokers
-----------------

Ramblings that make you think about the way you design. Not everything
can be solved with big servers, databases and transactions<!--more-->.

Amazon
------

Somewhat about the technology but more interesting is the culture and
organization they've created to work with it.

eBay

Interesting they dumped most of J2EE and use a lot of db partitioning.
Check out their site upgrade tool as well.

Consistency Models
------------------

Key to building systems that suit their environments is finding the
right tradeoff between consistency and availability.

    Consistency, Availability, Parition Tolerance cannot all be
    satisfied at once
